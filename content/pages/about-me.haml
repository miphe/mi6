  I am born and raised in Sweden (Stockholm) where I finished my studies in [Interactions Design](/experience) and started my web-journey.

  For little over five years I worked with [Redbet](/showcase/redbet) where I developed a love for Ruby MVCs and have been a fan ever since. I transferred to Malta in 2010 to start up and lead the front-end team there.

%p
  In late 2013 I decided to leave Malta and work in a way I previously thought wasn't quite possible yet - professionally, productively yet

    remotely

  I've been into the web scene since I can remember and I really enjoy the constant evolution of the industry. I try to keep updated with the latest and greatest stuff and to always keep my learning curve steep.

  When I'm not doing that, I enjoy Longboarding, Digital Painting, Archery and the occational try at the guitar.

  ## Skills/Technologies

  _I have most experience in development with these technologies._
